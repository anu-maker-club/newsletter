# TODO

1. Fixing styles so that they apply properly when inlined. Right now text
   colours don't work, and some of the margins are borked.
2. Text template as alternative to HTML template (which will itself be a
   multipart alternative)
3. Consider writing code to send emails, too; will probably leave this to Ming
   or whoever is responsible for sending FF out, though (since they likely have
   their own preferred way of sending things).
4. Inlining images
5. Producing complete emails instead of just HTML
