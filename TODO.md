# TODO

1. Fix styles so that they apply properly when inlined. Right now text colours
   don't work, and some of the margins are borked.
2. Consider writing code to send emails, too; will probably leave this to Ming
   or whoever is responsible for sending FF out, though (since they likely have
   their own preferred way of sending things).
